**BXHost** is a free, open-source desktop application that transforms any Windows Computer into your own Roblox server through a simple user-friendly Interface. You start by choosing a Roblox Place file (if you have none, there are place file samples provided you can use) and changing some server settings, then click the “Host Server” and **BXHost** will start up Roblox Studio in server mode for you with the options you picked. *It's that simple!*

There’s no automated port-forwarding built in, so you’ll need to handle any network configuration yourself *(use playit.gg, it's simple and easy to use)*, but beyond that you get full privacy, total control, no chat filter, and the freedom to run private playtests, or community tournaments anytime, all without needing to host it on Roblox.

**BXHost** will try to receive as many updates as possible to improve the experience of users on how they use **BXHost**. ***PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS THAT HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED!***
